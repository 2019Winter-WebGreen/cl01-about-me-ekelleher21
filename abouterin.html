        <h1>All About Erin Kelleher!</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>This web page is all about me, <b>Erin Kelleher</b>. I am currently 15 years old. My birthday is July 10th, 2003. I am attending school at Padua Academy and in 10th grade. My favorite movie is, <i>Moana. </i>My favortite qoute is, </p><blockquote>"Set the bar higher."</blockquote>
        <p>I have a fairly small family. I have a mom, a dad, a brother, and a dog. My mom's name is Laura and she went to St. Marks highschool and the University of West Chester. My dad's name is Sean and he went to Salesianum for highschool and Virginia Tech for college. My brothers name is Patrick, he is 17 and he is a senior at Salesianum. Last, I have a labradoodle named Guinness.</p>
        <p>I am apart of Padua's track and field team. My favorite event is pole vault. I started to pole vault at the end of seventh grade, right before I quit doing gymnastics for 7 years. As of right now the highest I've going is 12 feet 2 inches. </p>
